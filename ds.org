[2] We shall just have to pretend it's not there, there's not, 
    there's not quite as bad as when I had to speak for Amnesty 
    on Radio Essex last year and it was live [self&partner laugh], 
    as every word, every word I spoke was being you know [laugh] being heard by 
    a lot of people and that's, that was very, that was very intimidating.
#+end_example
- again it is hard to tell about the predictability
- laughable might be '...not quite as bad...'

#+begin_example
Ian (PS4GD)	[372] have to be away and we don't 
                        hear from you we think, #Oh you naughty boy, yes# .
John (PS4GC)	[373] #You might get worried, yes.#
Ian (PS4GD)	[374] We'll take him off the scheme [John laughs] because 
                        he hasn't replied to ... 
                        any of our correspondence .
John (PS4GC)	[375] Yes.
Ian (PS4GD)	[376] So er
#+end_example
- it is debatable whether laughable is the turn [374] or 'Oh you naughty boy'
- for the latter option: it is notable that John laughs at the
  relevant space (end of constituent) with a delay after the laughable
